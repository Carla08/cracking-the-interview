**Tips for solving problems**

1. Use multiple pointers. For example for keeping track of the past, 
for foreseeing the future or one slow and one quicker. If you're using a lot 
of them you can try to keep them labeled in a hashmap.

2. Magic methods that are useful: length, next, iter. For nodes implement equals and
hash. Implement repr for both.
